#Program description: An expanded entertainment menu with a bit more fun activities to do. 

I think I have officially made a halfway point for my project, My biggest challenge was getting some of the code to work and actually coming up with ideas to improve my existing code.  

Instructions on how to operate the program: 



The code will start with the main program, enter in the corresponding number to each thing that you can do in the menu. make sure the attached files are in the directory that
the code file is in. otherwise this code won't work unless you create a text file yourself and assign a variable to that text file. For the jokes part of the code, i'd recommend having a separate webpage up for each of the corresponding topics. If you want to add a miscellaneous joke have whatever source that is not the above topics up. Category 1 is NASA jokes, category 2 is dog jokes, category 3 is dinosaur jokes and category 4 is lawyer jokes and category 5 is miscellaneous. For trivia, just try to answer the questions to your ability. as for the rest of the code, I would like to focus my second half of the project on trying to make api calls for some of my other functions such as my favorite movie and game function and in some way improving my adventure story, possibly even something like interacting with GUIs as well as looking into the colorama/termcolor module to make colored output so that my code is less confusing.
